# DepGraph

This is a simple dependencies parsing visualizer using JavaScript canvas. It
depends on Stanford Parser for parsing, and visualize the sentence using
part-of-speech tags and parsing result. You could try it on
[http://depgraph.kube.zero.haus/](http://depgraph.kube.zero.haus/).

## Usage

You could input a sentence and let the program parse and visualize it for you.

## License

Since Stanford Parser is released under GPL, I'm releasing this software using
GPL too.
